# Students Records API

This repo provides a template for setting up a flask rest API server. As a starting point, it shows an example of a simple hello world endpoint as well as endpoints that offer interactions with student records.

## Prerequisites

- python 3.10 or higher
- MongoDB installed. Follow [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
to install MongoDB locally. Select the right link for your operating system.

## Tech Stack

This flask web app uses:

- [Flask-RESTX][flask-restx] for creating REST APIs. Directory structure
follows [flask restx instructions on scaling your project][flask-restx-scaling]
  - flask-restx automatically generates
  [OpenAPI specifications][openapi-specification] for your API
- [PyMongo][pymongo] for communicating with the mongodb database
- [pytest][pytest] for testing
(see [flask specific testing instructions on pytest][pytest-flask]
for more info specific to testing Flask applications)
- [mongomock][mongomock] for mocking the mongodb during unit testing

[mongomock]: https://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/mongomock.html

## Running Locally

This assumes you are already running MongoDB (e.g., through
`brew services restart mongodb-community` on MacOS or
`sudo systemctl restart mongod` on Linux.
Find the equivalent for your OS)

### Setting up the environment

1. Check `.samplenv` file and follow the instructions there to create
your `.env` file
2. Run `make dev_env` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies

### Running the server

1. Run `make run_local_server` to run the server. This will also run the tests first.
2. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see it running!

You can use `ctrl-c` to stop the server.

### Testing the API server

Run `make tests` to execute the test suite and see the coverage report
in your terminal. You can also see a visual report by viewing
[/htmlcov/index.html](/htmlcov/index.html) in your browser.

### Manually activating and deactivating the virtual environment

Manually activating and deactivating the virtual environment is useful for
debugging issues and running specific scripts with flexibility (e.g., you can
run `FLASK_APP=app flask run --debug --host=0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
inside the virtual environment to directly start
the server without running tests first).

To activate the virtual environment manually:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```sh
. .venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment:

```sh
deactivate
```
